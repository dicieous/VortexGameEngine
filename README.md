#### *"Yes, I know Unreal and Unity exist. No, I donâ€™t want to talk about it."* ðŸ™‚

## **Overview**
- Vortex Game Engine is an in-development Game Engine, designed as a portfolio project to explore modern game Engine Development.You can clone the repository and experiment with making games using Vortex, but it is not yet at the level of a professional game engine.

## **Features**

### Current Features
The Engine is currently in it's initial days with some of the Basic Engine Features. I'll Keep on Updating the Table as I add new Features.

| **Feature**   |  **Description**        |
| :-------- |  :------------------------- |
| 2D Rendering Engine |  *2D Renderer Supporting Sprite Based Rendering & Shader Support.* |
| 2D Physics Engine|  *Basic 2D Physics Engine with Box2D in the Backend.* |
| Project Management System |  *Basic Project Management using YAML.* |
| Scene Management System |  *Scene Management support using YAML for smooth integration with ECS.* |
| Entity Component System (ECS)|  *ECS integration with entt as the Base.* |
| Asset Management System |  *Basic Asset Management system with Caching.* |
| GUI Editor |  *Game Engine Editor Layer which uses ImGui at backend for GUI.* |
| Event System |  *Event system API which works seamlessly with the Different Inputs in the Game Engine from the user Side too.* |
| Logger |  *Logging System Implemented using Spdlog* |

### Future Features
These are the features planned by me as of yet. Would Keep on Adding more as the list starts getting Shorter.

| **Feature**   |  **Description**        |
| :-------- |  :------------------------- |
| 3D Rendering Engine |  *3D Renderer to Supporting PBR, IBL, Shadows and other 3D Rendering Features* |
| 3D Physics Engine  |  *3D Physics Support with Physics Materials integrated with Bolt.* |
| C# Scripting |  *C# Scripting Engine support for User Side.* |
| Audio Library |  *Audio Library with both 2D and 3D Audio Support.* |
| Profiler |  *currently the Engine have a very basic Profiler. Will Implement a GUI based profiler (Most Probably Tracy)* |
| Glyphs |  *Would Implement Font Rendering using Slug Library(Most Probably).* |

## **Getting Started**

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- A modern C++ compiler supporting C++17 (or higher).
- [Premake](https://premake.github.io/) (v5+ recommended)
- Git

### Building the Project


1. **Clone the Repository**: Make sure you do a **recursive** clone!
```bash
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/dicieous/VortexGameEngine.git
```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

```bash
  cd VortexGameEngine
```

3. **Build the Project**: 
  - If you're in Command Prompt and in the Root Directory of the Engine below command to run the batch file to run premake to build the Project.
  ```bash
  Scripts/Win-GenProjects.bat
```
  - You can just go in the Scripts folder and click on ```Win-GenProjects.bat``` to Build the Project.

### Running the Application

- After a successful build, you can open the engine with the ```VortexEngine.sln``` and build the binaries in Debug or Release and Run the Project.
- You'll be greeted with the Vortex Editor. There you can press Play button to see physics in play, Add and Delete Components and do other stuff.
- As the Engine is still in development you cannot make a game from the Editor yet. But if you want to Play with the Engine you can set the Sandbox Project as the StartUp Project and Try stuff there in ```SandBox2D.cpp``` or you can make your own layer and Add it in the ```Sandbox Class``` in ```SandBoxApp.cpp```.

```cpp
class SandBox : public Vortex::Application
{
public:
	SandBox(Vortex::ApplicationSpecifications& specfications)
		:Vortex::Application(specfications)
	{
		//Push your Layer Here
		PushLayer(new SandBox2D());
	}

	~SandBox()
	{

	}
};

Vortex::Application* Vortex::CreateApplication(ApplicationCommandLineArgs args)
{
	ApplicationSpecifications specs;
	specs.Name = "Vortex SandBox";
	specs.WorkingDirectory = "../VortexEditor";

	return new SandBox(specs);
}
```
